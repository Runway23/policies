# Terms of Service
Last Updated: 15th of February, 2024
Effective: 1st of March, 2024

Hey! These are the Runway23 Terms of Service, when using any service provided by Runway23, you agree to the following Terms of Service ("ToS"). This document outlines our legal obligations to each other. They apply to all Runway23 services.

We may update these terms at any time, but we will always attempt to notify you 30 business days before they come into effect via notifications systems put in place by us (e.g., mailing lists, service notifications, etc). When doing so we will refresh the date at the top of this document and include a date in which they become effective.

## Definitions

When we use the terms and names "Runway23" or "R23", we refer to the trade name used by Aeropista SAS.

When we use the terms "we", "our", or "us" in any of our policies and/or terms, we refer to Aeropista SAS.

When we use the term "Services" in any of our policies and/or terms, we refer to our websites, services, and products created and maintained by Aeropista SAS.

When we use the terms "you" or "your", we are referring to you, the person or organisation that owns the account used to access our Services. If you're acting on behalf of a legal entity (e.g., your employer), you agree that you have the legal authority to bind that entity to these terms and act on behalf of them, and "you" and "your" will refer to that entity.

We also provide a [Privacy Policy](privacy.md) that applies to your use of our Services, and is incorporated into these terms.

We and our business partners may also offer individual services with their own policies and terms that you must agree to in order to use them, separate to these terms. We list the following terms and policies for our individual services:

## Warranty

WITHIN THE MARGINS SET BY THE APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RUNWAY23, ITS AFFILIATES AND/OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SUPPLIERS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, ABOUT THE SERVICES OFFERED. THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS.

If you are not legally considered an adult based on the laws of the jurisdiction you reside in, your parent, guardian or legal representative must read these Terms on your behalf. If you are a parent, guardian or legal representative and you allow your child/representee (who meets the minimum age for digital consent within your jurisdiction) to use our Services, then these terms also apply to you, and you are responsible to attain the legal obligations marked between us and your child/representee.

## Account Terms

To access our Services on an ongoing basis, you may have to create an account within one of our Services. Accounts are service-specific and their individual requirements to create and use one vary between Services, but we typically ask you to provide a username and password.

You must be human to create and use your account. Accounts created through automated means such as "bots" and "scripts" are not permitted and are subject to termination.

You are responsible for maintaining and safekeeping the security of your account. We are not liable for any loss or damage from your failure to protect your account. We recommend you use a secure password and, if available, enable two-factor authentication for your account.

You may not use our Services for any purpose outlined as prohibited within this document and/or Service-specific terms or policies.

You are responsible for all posted content and activity that occurs under your account.

You agree to not license, sell or transfer your account without prior written approval.

## Discontinuation

We intend to maintain our Services for as long as it is possible and reasonable to do so. This means that we will attempt to continue to maintain and develop all of our Services — including legacy ones — from an availability, security, privacy and support standpoint for as long as we can. However, we reserve the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, partially or fully, our Services at any time. 

When possible, we will attempt to notify you of changes done to our Services within 180 days from it's discontinuation.

### Migration (if applicable)
 
During the discontinuation process of a Service, we will provide you with a copy of your personal data used by that Service for you to export and import to other services operated by us or a third party. 

## Prohibitions

In order for us to safely operate our Services, we have set in place a set of prohibitions  when you use any of Runway23's services, you agree that you shall not:

In case you breach these prohibitions and/or those put in place by service-specific policies, your account may be subject to restriction or cancellation to our Services.

## Cancellation

Cancellation involves the discontinuation/termination of access to our Services, and the termination of agreements between you and Runway23. 

Once your account is cancelled, you will no longer have access to it and your data will be destroyed within the specified periods provided in our [Privacy Policy](privacy.md). Cancellation is of immediate effect most of the time and it is non-reversible.

Depending on the reason for cancellation, you may or may not be able to use our Services again, please contact us for more information.

### Your right to cancel

You are free to stop using our Services at any time for any reason. 

For account deletion and thereby agreement termination, options depend on the Service that you are using, but as per our [Privacy Policy](privacy.md), you can always email us at privacy@r23.xyz to remove your account and delete your data.

### Our right to cancel
Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to restrict, or terminate access, to some, or to all of our Services with or without prior notice at our discretion for the following reasons:

- We believe that continuing you to access our Service may cause harm to us, other users, or third parties
- We are required to do so to comply a legal requirement or court order

We will often try to resolve issues that may merit termination directly with you through the predetermined communication channels set with each other. If we are not able to get in contact with you in a timely manner, resolve these issues or we believe that it is not possible to do so, we will inform you of your termination 7 days before it occurs.
