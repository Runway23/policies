At Runway23, we've set a number of commitments and morals that we base our company culture on, this way both us and our customers can be on the same page on what is to be expected from us and what our end goals as a corporation are.

These commitments are inspired by those of [37signals](https://37signals.com/).

## Customers are customers, not products
Our users are customers, they're people who use our products and who spend resources on them. They are not products themselves and they will never be.

We pledge to never try to profit from selling **you**. This means no advertising, no data selling, etc.

## We sell to you directly, and that's how we make money
Just like it's been since the inception of society, we rely on trading. And we prefer to do business by directly trading with you, no middlemen or extra parties involved; only you and us â€” partners until the end.

You give us money, we give you a product. Simple as.

## We'd rather die free that live tied up
We are committed to always remain independent. When we're independent, we're able to do things that nobody else would dare to do. With no eyes upon us watching every step we take, we can run as fast as we can and wherever we want. 

Because of that, we're free from any investors or board. Our only shareholders are us.

## We work together, and we own together too
We're a worker-owned company, this means that every person working at Runway23 is entitled to having a say on every decision within the company; and they of course own their own share of it.

This allows us to be independent, and to work in what we love with total freedom. It's our love an passion on the line, not anyone else.

## A work of love and passion
Runway23 was founded upon the basis of wanting to offer quality services and products that we ourselves would use. We work hard to deliver something made from the bottom of our hearts, since this is the only way for us to all be on the same page on what our quality standards should be.

It's been like that since the start, it will remain to be like that until the end.

## Freedom to work
Our corporate culture is to simply work on what we want and desire, this is the best way for us to learn and develop things that we are actually satisfied with and in which we can all work together in sync; a similar method can be found in the [Montessori education system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education), in which children learn on their own using pre-determined conditions which they pick up based on their interests.

We are free to work on what we want rather than on what we're given. That's how we do our best.

## Pitch, not pick
At our core, we're basically a project incubator. When you join, that probably means that you're here to work on your own personal project which you've decided to give to us so we could all work on it together.

At a glance, this might seem counter productive and messy, but in practice this has been the best way for us to network with eachother and find projects which we might have not even known we were interested in.

## Give yourself a name that describes yourself
Runway23 started as a company named Northern, this name was chosen under the idea of us always pushing forward to keep going up the ranks and eyes of the public. In January 2024, we decided that we would instead take to the skies and depart to the north-east.

Our name still has many other implications, but if we had to choose only one; we simply wanted to go higher than anyone's ever been.

## When the wind's against you, don't give up the fight
Always keep two things in mind, Murphy's law and the [lyrics to Airfield by Enter Shikari](https://genius.com/Enter-shikari-airfield-lyrics).

We're gonna fuck up eventually, but that's a moment for us to take advantage of the fast winds rather than to abort our flight and back down. Hard times make us stronger, it's only a matter for us to keep pushing.

## A diverse crew to satisfy a diverse crowd
We're creators. We all come from different background and specialities, some of us are engineers while others are designers, while some of us are musicians and others are writers.

When you're working on so many things for so many people, it only makes sense that we also have people of many colours who can pick up things they're interested in and grow them as much as they'd like.

## We're all over the place
Instead of narrowing our teams down to specific locations and groups, we instead work from all over the world remotely. This way we don't shorten ourselves from finding the best of the best *in an area* but rather *across the planet*.

We're headquartered on Mexico City, but we have members on Spain and the US. [Feel free to extend that list here.](https://r23.xyz/join)

## Peace
We're not here to retell the stories of war over and over, we're here to create something new that we can all be part of. So it makes no sense to keep looking at everything like if it's a fight.

Don't use terms like "conquer the market", "target customers", "dethrone the big guys", etc. We're a company, not a crusade.

## Your worst enemy could be your best friend
Instead of narrowing our mind and continue those war-themed cycles of "fighting with our rivals", we prefer to work and collaborate with them. We're not in the industrial revolution anymore, we're instead in an era of uncertainty that we can mould to create more collectively.

We're always open to collaborations with other companies, and we will always take on them if possible. Together we're bigger than the big guys, and together we can create more than them.
