As of the 13th of February 2024, Aeropista SAS (herein â€” as per its commercial name, Runway23) has not:
- received a legal order enforceable in it's jurisdiction to provide any information of its customers
- received a legal order preventing the disclosure and public exposure of any broad order

Runway23 would like to remind its customers and all interested parties that we'd rather wind down operations before cooperating in actions which may harm the human and digital rights of its customers and all related entities under pressure of any government or organisation.

This canary will be updated every 90 days, starting on 2024-02-13, in order to communicate Runway23's legal and moral status for interested parties to verify its transparency and commitment. Failure to do say does not necessarily indicate that Runway23 has received a gag order or that it has been compromised by external parties, but rather that something in our end has not gone as expected. We ask our customers to be vigilant for future modifications and/or removal of this warrant canary.
